## About-📄

---

A Simple React Native App using Typescript and React Context

## Best Practices 🤩

---

- In this application we are following the airbnb guideline
- In this application we are following SOLID principles
- In this application we are following the KISS pattern

## Git Patterns 😻

---

In this application was used some good practices from `gitFlow`

### Opening branches

- `[feature/fix/hotfix]/{task-name}`

  - `feature`: Reserved for the development of new features, or continuing old features;
  - `hotfix`: reserved for fixing problems of already merged master branches;
  - `fix`: reserved for fixing code problems like a refactor.

### Types of commit messages

- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- test: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
- chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

example:

```
[feat]: user-form(new user field)
```

## Tests 🧪

---

- In this application we have unit and integration tests
  - In this application, the unit tests are used on components folder, like:
    - Screen/
      - index.tsx
      - screen.styles.tsx
      - **screen.test.tsx**
  - In this application, the integration tests are used on feature folder
    - Home/
      - components/
      - index.tsx
      - **home.test.tsx**
      - home.hook.ts
      - home.styles.ts

## Mocks 📦

---

In this application we are using `axios-mock-adapter` to simulate an real API

- On Mocks folder, we can create routes by feature
- Each feature can contain seeds that would help with the fake data
